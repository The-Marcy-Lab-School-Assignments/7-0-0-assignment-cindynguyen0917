# Question

What happens when the setter function returned by `useState` is invoked?

# Answer
When the setter function returned by `useState` is invoked there are a series of actions that take place. Firstly, the current state value is updated. This action triggers React to re-render the component again with the new data. This new 'state' that has been rendered on the virtual DOM will be compared to the previous state, where React will update the DOM accordingly.
