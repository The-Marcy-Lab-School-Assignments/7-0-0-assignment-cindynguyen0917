# Question

What is the return value of the `useState` hook in React? Be specific â€” just telling us the type is not enough.

# Answer

The `useState` hook in React returns an array containing two values: the current state value and a setter function that is used to update/set the current state. The state refers to a built-in object that holds properties pertaining to the component and the current state value can be any data type.
