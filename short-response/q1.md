# Question

In your own words, what is React and what are the benefits of using it?

# Answer

React is a javascript libarary that uses JSX components to develop web applications that can scale efficiently by updating and rendering the virtual DOM. The benefits of using React is that because it uses components, React can be looked at modularly, where code is reusable and easier to maintain. Adding to this, React uses a declarative style within it's component composition, making coding and bedugging more intuitive. And lastly, since React uses a virtual DOM, updating is optimized as the process is abstracted. The virtual DOM helps re-render the user interface with mininal DOM operations.
